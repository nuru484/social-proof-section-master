## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Mobile-first workflow and some advanced CSS concepts like media quiries


### Continued development

Although the project looks great, I think I need to improve the CSS code, and so, I will be doing some extra work on CSS and see how I can improve even more on that.


### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - I think ChatGPT is like my personal intelligent assistant, it helps in almost everything not only when I am writting code.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp) - This is mostly where I read documentations.
